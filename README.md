Implementation of ML algorithms
This repository is for those people who understands the concepts and appication of Machine Learning but find it difficult to implement them in Python due to poor programming skills.
Here is my apporach to sharpen the skills via implementing what you already know via PL.

In ML we deal with supervised, unsupervised and anomaly detection learning problems.
Under supervised learning we have 2 categories:
a)Regression Problems(Linear and Non Linear Regression): It focusess on regression towards mean. When we have a linear line between x(known value) and y(unknown value) it is linear, when we cannot find a straight line then it is termed as Non linear regression.
b) Classification : When we classify data into classes. We use several methods to perform classification:: 1) Decision Tree 2)Rule based 3) Backpropagation 4) Lazy Learners
In unsupervised Learning we have Clustering(its an unsupervised classification).
Anomaly Detection: here an outlier needs to be spotted in the data.

So, in ML, we have learning in every kind of problem, but what needs to be learned in the given problem differentiate the kind of ML problem.

ML offers us some algorithms which can be used to sole our problems. Based on the set of instructions of algo and nature of he problem we decide wich algorithm is required to use in which problem.
In ML we have algorithms (set of meaningful instructions) like: a) Linear Regression b) Logistic Regression c) Decision Tree d) Naive Bayes e) k-Means f) SVM g) Random Forest
